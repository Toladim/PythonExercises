"""Note: this is a 4-chili exercise, not because it introduces a concept,

Write a password generator in Python.
Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters,
uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
Include your run-time code in a main method.

Extra:

Ask the user how strong they want their password to be.
For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list."""
